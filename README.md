# asc-data-preprocessing

# Task

1. Do `exercise/excercise_0*.ipynb` by following the instruction in the comment out. They are not grading items. So feel free to change as you wish.

2. Implement the functions in `assignments/assignment.py`. This is the grading item.


# FAQ

1. `No Module <...> found` when running a script although the notebooks and interactive mode work.

All modules are installed in the virtual environment. To see where you are, run the following on the terminal:
```bash
which python
```
if your path does not contain `venv`, it's likely that you are outside of the environment. Then, run on the terminal:
```bash
source /home/vscode/venv/bin/activate
```

2. I would like to test the code in the terminal. How do I do that?

You can run the test on your codespace by running the following on the project root:
```bash
python -m unittest test/test.py
```

3. The instructor made a correction. How can I reflect the changes in my code?

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

4. When merging the changes, my code conflicts with the changes from the instructor. How can I resolve the conflicts?


To resolve conflicts using the command line options `--theirs` and `--ours` with `git checkout`, follow these steps:

- To keep the changes from the current branch (the one you are merging into), use:
  ```bash
  git checkout --ours
  ```
- To keep the changes from the branch you are merging from, use:
  ```bash
  git checkout --theirs
  ```
After resolving the conflicts, don't forget to add the files to staging (`git add .`), and then commit the changes to complete the merge process.


## Git Cheat Sheet

Here's a quick reference to some common Git commands you might find useful:

## Basic Git Commands

- **`git status`**: Check the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.

- **`git add <file>`**: Add a file or changes to the staging area for Git. Replace `<file>` with the name of the file you want to add.

- **`git commit -m "message"`**: Commit your changes to the local repository with a commit message. Replace `"message"` with your commit message.

- **`git push`**: Push your commits from your local repository to the remote repository.

## Branching and Merging

- **`git checkout <branch>`**: Switch to another branch in your repository. Replace `<branch>` with the name of the branch you want to switch to.

- **`git merge <branch>`**: Merge changes from another branch into the current branch. Replace `<branch>` with the name of the branch you want to merge from.

- **`git branch`**: List, create, or delete branches. Without additional arguments, it lists existing branches. Use `-d <branch>` to delete a branch, and `<branch>` to create a new branch.

## Remote Repository Operations

- **`git fetch`**: Fetch changes from the remote repository to your local repository but does not merge them.

- **`git pull`**: Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch. This command is used to update your local repository to match the remote repository.

- **`git clone <repository>`**: Clone a repository into a new directory. Replace `<repository>` with the URL of the repository you want to clone.

## File Operations

- **`git rm <file>`**: Remove a file from your working directory and stage the deletion. Replace `<file>` with the name of the file you want to remove.

## History and Difference Checking

- **`git log`**: Show the commit logs.

- **`git log --oneline`**: Show the commit history in a concise format. This is useful for getting a quick overview of the commit history.

- **`git diff`**: Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc. Use `git diff --staged` to see changes staged for the next commit.

## Advanced Operations

- **`git reset`**: Reset current HEAD to the specified state. Use `--hard` to discard all changes in your working directory and index, `--soft` to keep your working directory but reset the index.

- **`git revert <commit>`**: Create a new commit that undoes all of the changes made in `<commit>`, then apply it to the current branch.

- **`git stash`**: Stash the changes in a dirty working directory away. Use `git stash apply` to bring back the stashed changes.

- **`git tag <tagname>`**: Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG. Replace `<tagname>` with the desired tag for your commit.

Remember to replace placeholders (like `<repository>`, `<branch>`, or `<commit>`) with actual repository URLs, branch names, or commit hashes as needed for your specific commands.
